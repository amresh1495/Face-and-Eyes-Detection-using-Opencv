## Face and Eyes Detection using Opencv

In this project, I have tried to detect face and eyes in a video feed using the haarcascade classifier trained on face and eyes. I have used the opencv package for implementing it using python.

- I have attached a screenshot of the app running and detecting my face and eyes.

### Setup 

- Install the required packages by running  ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

- Run the app by command ```python app.py```
